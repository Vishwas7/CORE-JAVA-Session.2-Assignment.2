

Compiler and Interpreter both carry out the same purpose – convert a high level language (like C, Java) 
instructions into the binary form which is understandable by computer hardware. 
They are the software used to execute the high level programs and codes to perform various tasks. 
However both compiler and interpreter have the same objective but they differ in the way they accomplish their 
task.

Difference between compiler and interpreter.

1. A complier converts the high level instruction into machine language while an interpreter converts 
   the high level instruction into an intermediate form.

2. Before execution, entire program is executed by the compiler whereas after translating the 
   first line, an interpreter then executes it and so on.

3. List of errors is created by the compiler after the compilation process while an interpreter 
   stops translating after the first error.

4. An independent executable file is created by the compiler whereas interpreter is required by an 
   interpreted program each time.
